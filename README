BEE YARDS AS AUTONOMOUS GREEN DATA CLUSTERS

Development of solar-powered, multi-sensor electronic Beehive monitors. A novel aspect of this research is the focus on using digital data to construct patterns for detecting and predicting beehive diseases and obtaining objective measures along with usage of different data mining \& computer vision techniques.
